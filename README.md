# OpenfoldDoctor

**OpenfoldDoctor** is an extension of the [OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold) project, designed to enhance protein folding simulations with advanced inspection capabilities. With OpenfoldDoctor, users can gain deeper insights into the folding process through various export functionalities.

## üöÄ Features

- **Export intermediate protein structures**: Capture and export all intermediate states of protein structures during the folding simulation.
- **Folding progression movie**: Generate a "movie" showing the trajectory of protein folding, providing a visual representation of the entire process.
- **MSA and pair representations**:
  - **MSA**: Visualize Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) data through heatmaps.
  - **Pair representation**: Export heatmaps of pairwise interactions at each iteration of the simulation.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started with OpenfoldDoctor, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the original OpenFold repository**

Begin by cloning the original OpenFold repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the OpenFold Directory
Move into the cloned OpenFold directory:

```bash
cd openfold
```

### 3. Download the OpenfoldDoctor patch
Download the `openfold_doctor.patch` file from the OpenfoldDoctor releases. Ensure you save the patch file to a known location on your local machine.

### 4. Checkout the `pl_upgrades branch`
Switch to the `pl_upgrades` branch and reset it to the specific commit `3bec3e9b2d1e8bdb83887899102eff7d42dc2ba9`:

```bash
git checkout pl_upgrades
git reset --hard 3bec3e9b2d1e8bdb83887899102eff7d42dc2ba9
```

### 5. Apply the OpenfoldDoctor patch
Apply the downloaded patch using to incorporate OpenfoldDoctor's enhancements:

```bash
git am --3way /path/to/openfold_doctor.patch
```

**Note**: Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to your downloaded `openfold_doctor.patch` file.

### 6. Proceed with OpenFold installation
Continue with the [original OpenFold installation process](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold/blob/pl_upgrades/README.md).

Ensure you follow all the steps outlined in the OpenFold installation guide to set up the environment correctly with the new dependencies introduced by OpenfoldDoctor.

## üìà Usage
After installation, you can use OpenfoldDoctor's features to inspect and visualize the protein folding process. Refer to the documentation and examples provided in the repository for detailed usage instructions.
